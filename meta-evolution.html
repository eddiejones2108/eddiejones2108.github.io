      <h3>On Meta-Evolution</h3>
      <blockquote>
        Suppose I had found a watch upon the ground,
        and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place;
        &#8230;
        there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The watchmaker analogy is quite a compelling argument for creationism; the complexity of life appears beyond
        the scope of randomness. What it underestimates, however, is not randomness but the sheer power of time.

        In much of the world, natural selection has come to be generally accepted as the driving force behind life's
        development. Traits that help some species to survive in a particular environment increase that organism chance
        of reproduction, and therefore, the spread of that trait. Couple this <em>survival of the fittest</em> mechanism
        with the occasional mutation (to add new traits into the pool) and over time species will <em>adapt</em> to
        their environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        This phenomenon also plays out in artificial optimisation problems and has even been used to design NASA
        equipment.

    <section>
      <p>
        There is another aspect to evolution, however, and that is <em>sexual selection</em>.
        Under sexual selection, adaptation is not driven by the environment but sexual preferences.
        It is often looked upon as a side effect of evolution &mdash; the unintended downside of randomness.
      </p>

    <section>
      <p>
        It is not necessarily the only factor, but the preferences of an individual organism are directed by evolution.
        If this is the case, then sexual selection must also be under the influence of evolution.
        Or in other words, evolution is subject to its own laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the random seed from which traits evolve, they are often heuristic in nature.
        This allows them to be effective without detailed knowledge of the scenario in which they will be tested.
        Evolution is, in some sense, a <em>heuristic</em> design procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
        It must also be, therefore, a <em>self-modifying</em> heuristic design procedure.
      </p>

    <section>
      <p>But what difference does this make?</p>
      <p>
        Well, let us consider how this would play out in an analogous computational setting.
        Genetic algorithms generally consist of: a fixed objective function, a cross-over rate, and a mutation rate.
        At each time step, the population is evaluated against the objective function.
        The genetics of most successful individuals are combined using the latter two parameters, and the process
        repeats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose instead the genetics of individuals are allowed to dictate with whom they breed.
        The original objective function still stands, but it can only remove substandard individuals.
        In this scenario, sexual selection should naturally arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        This additional degree of freedom has the potential to overcome <em>local extrema</em> in the objective
        function as the population can temporarily flirt (heuristically) with some suboptimal trait. While a similar
        result might occur without sexual selection, it cannot be driven by anything other than luck. In the long run,
        it is likely to be less efficient and more error-prone. Although sexual preference <em>emerges</em> as the
        result of luck, it is no luckier than the letters I type. It is not by any means necessitated, but, given enough
        time, the survival of the fittest should allow individual with a sense for upcoming local extrema in the gene
        pool, and the inclination to steer around these points, to prosper.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with any other evolutionary heuristic behaviour, there is no reason why the latency of the genetic design
        space or the optimisation problem should prevent this optimisation from occurring.

      <h3>On Meta-Evolution</h3>
      <blockquote>
        Suppose I had found a watch upon the ground,
        and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place;
        &#8230;
        there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The watchmaker anology is quite a compeling argument for creationism; the complexity of life appears beyond
        the scope of randomness.
        What it underestimates, however, is not randomness but the sheer power of time.

        In much of the world, natural selection has come to be generally accepted as the driving force behind life's
        development.
        Traits that help some species to survive in a particular environment increase that organism chance of
        reproduction, and therefore, the spread of that trait.
        Couple this <em>survive of the fitest</em> with the occational mutation (to add new traits into the pool) and
        overtime specises will adapt to their environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        This process has also been shown to play out in artifical optimisation problems.
        It has even been used to design NASA equipment.

      There is another aspect to evolution, however, and that is <em>sexual selection</em>.

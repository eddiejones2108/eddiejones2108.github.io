      Linear Logic
    </h2>

    <p>
      Suppose apples cost a &pound;1
      If you have &pound;1 you can have an apple and so we might be tempted to write &pound;1 &rArr; &#127823;
      But from this we can derive &pound;1 &rArr; &#127823; &xwedge; &#127823;, so it seems there is a buy one get one free offer on?
    </p>

    <p>
      Linear logic acts as an accountant for greengroceers by considering resources rather than true.
      And unlike truth, resources can be used up.
      The proposition &pound;1 &mumap; &#127823; specifically states that the pound is consumed in the production of the apple.
      It does not follow, therefore, that &pound;1 &mumap; &#127823; &otimes; &#127823;, where the &otimes; symbol clarrifies that we are actually talking about two apples.

    <h2>
      Linear Logic
    </h2>

    <p>
      Suppose apples cost &pound;1; if you have &pound;1, you can have an apple.
      In fact we might be tempted to write &pound;1 &rArr; &#127823;, but from this we can derive &pound;1 &rArr; &#127823; &xwedge; &#127823;.
      There seems to be some sort of buy one get one free offer on?
    </p>

    <p>
      Linear logic acts as an accountant for greengroceers by considering resources rather than true, but unlike truth, resources can be used up.
      The proposition &pound;1 &mumap; &#127823; specifically states that the pound is consumed in the production of the apple.
      It does not follow, therefore, that &pound;1 &mumap; &#127823; &otimes; &#127823;.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here the &otimes; symbol acts somewhat like classical conjunction, but clarifies that we are actually talking about two <em>separate</em> apples.
      So &pound;1 &otimes; &pound;1 means something like &pound;2.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Linear Algebra
    </h2>

    <p>
      Linear algebra on the other hand is to the nearest approximation the study space and linear transformations.
      The type of space were intrested in can be abstract, but is required to behave somewhat like Euclidean space, so your intuition should suffice.
      Let's unpack this notion of transformation however:
    </p>

    <p>
      A linear transformation is a function that preserves the origin.
      That is the zero point is mapped to the zero point.
      Futhermore, any straight lines in the input space must also be straight lines in the output space.
      That is it!
      This class of functions is surpisingly common as it include rotations and scaling in any combination.

      Nature's ability to organise itself is not just impressive but often beautiful too.
      When a group of starlings flock together, they create a mesmerising acrobatic performance.
      Apparently, we're not the only species that like to dance!

      It's not just biologists that find the sight fascinating.
      There is a whole field of computer science dedicated to abstracting and replicating these emergent behaviours,
      particularly in optimisation.
      If you can't beat 'em, join 'em!
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Boids</em> was one of the first algorithms designed to mimic flocking behaviour.
      Each boid is governed by three simple forces:
    <ul>
      <li>Separation: try not to crash</li>
      <li>Cohesion: follow the crowd</li>
      <li>Alignment: look where the crowd is looking</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      While these forces update individual boids, they are inherently dependent on the position of neighbouring boids,
      let's call it the <em>context</em>&#8230;
    </p>

    <h2>
      Context-aware Pogramming
    </h2>

    <p>
      Monads have been widely adopted in the functional programming community, but dual, <em>co</em>-monads,
      are sadly not so popular &#128542;
      I'm going to assume you've already come across the former as there are so many brilliant <a
        href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2016/11/21/monads-programmers-definition/">monad tutorials</a> that my
      introduction would just confuse the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefly though monads are just a convention for adding structure to the output of a function.
      This allows us to clearly differentiate between the <span class="blue">result</span> and its
      <span class="red">side-effects</span>:
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      f :: a -> <span class="red">m</span> <span class="blue">b</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      If we are to compose these functions we must also be able to compose the side-effects; they form a monoid with
      unit (return) and multiplication (join):
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      return :: <span class="blue">a</span> -> <span class="red">m</span> <span class="blue">a</span>
      <br>
      join :: <span class="red">m</span> (<span class="red">m</span> <span class="blue">a</span>) -> <span
        class="red">m</span> <span class="blue">a</span>

    </div>
    <p>
      Similarly, comonads add structure to the input of the function; they tell us what's the <span
        class="red">context</span> and what's the <span class="blue">focus</span>.
      How do we decide which bit of information belongs where? Well, this is no different to deciding what counts as a
      <em>side</em>-effect; perhaps I meant to put that bug there!?&#8230; it depends on the application.
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      f :: <span class="red">w</span> <span class="blue">a</span> -> b
    </div>
    <p>
      As comonads are dual to monads they form a comonoid. Approximately means that we can split apart context into
      nested contexts. To understand this dual notion of composition, it is best to think of our comonad as some sort of
      container. Within this container there are lots of objects of type <span class="blue">a</span>, one of
      which is the current focus. However, we could focus on any of them, and they will all have a different view of
      their context. The <em>duplicate</em> function records this context from each possible perspective, creating a
      container of containers:
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      duplicate :: <span class="red">w</span> <span class="blue">a</span> ->
      <span class="red">w</span> (<span class="red">w</span> <span class="blue">a</span>)
    </div>

    <p>
      The corresponding notion of return (i.e. the unit) is when the function doesn't depend on it's context.
      The <em>extract</em> function just retunns the focus:
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      extract :: <span class="red">w</span> <span class="blue">a</span> ->
      <span class="blue">a</span>
    </div>

    <h2>
      The Flock Comonad
    </h2>

    <p>
      Our three boid update functions have a natural focus and context; the current boid we're updating and it's
      neighbours.
      In other words, the flock is a <span class="red">container</span> full of
      <span class="blue">boids</span> that is ripe for comonadification.
    </p>

    <div class="code-line">
      type <span class="red">Flock</span> <span class="blue">a</span> = Map &reals;<sup><small>2</small></sup> <span
        class="blue">a</span>
    </div>

    <p>
      Concretely, we shall represent a flock as partial map between positions and boids.
      The boid in focus will be in position (0, 0), which we shall assume is always inhabitated.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's in the duplicate function where the real magic happens. As we just mentioned, each boid will have a different
      view of the flock, and the duplicate function encodes this view. In terms of linear algebra we can think of each
      boid being replaced by a copy of the flock except there has been a change of basis so that the focus, i.e. the
      zero point, is that boid.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Haskell this means we are constructing a new map with the same keys but where each element is a copy of the
      flock with the keys shfited by the inverse of v:
    </p>

    <div class="code-line" style="font-size: 1.25em;">
      duplicate f = mapWithKey (\v _ -> mapKey (subtract v) f) f
    </div>

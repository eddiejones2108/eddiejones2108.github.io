      Nature's ability to organise itself is not just impressive but often beautiful too.
      When a group of starlings flock together, they create a mesmerising acrobatic performance.
      Apparently, we're not the only species that like to dance!

      It's not just biologists that find the sight fascinating.
      There is a whole field of computer science dedicated to abstracting and replicating these emergent behaviours with a variety of applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">Boids</a> was one of the first algorithms designed to mimic flocking
      behaviour.
      Each boid (read bird) is governed by three simple forces:
    <ul>
      <li>Separation: try not to crash</li>
      <li>Cohesion: stick together</li>
      <li>Alignment: head where the crowd is heading</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      While these forces affect individual boids, they are inherently dependent on the position of neighbouring boids
      &mdash; the context.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Context-aware Pogramming
    </h2>

    <p>
      Monads have been widely adopted in the functional programming community, but their dual, <em>co</em>-monads, are
      sadly not so popular &#128542;
      Although monads play a broad and important role in category theory. For a programmer they are essentially a
      convention for adding structure to the output of a function.
      In particular, they allows us to clearly delineate its <span class="blue">result</span> and <span
        class="red">side-effects</span>:
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      f :: a -> <span class="red">m</span> <span class="blue">b</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      Of course, this convention is meaningless without laws.
      For monads, the laws concern the composition of effectful functions and the ability to lift pure functions into
      this richer context.
      Monadic functions must behave somewhat like pure functions in that composition is associative and has an identity.
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      (>>=) :: <span class="red">m</span> <span class="blue">a</span> -> (<span class="blue">a</span> -> <span
        class="red">m</span> <span class="blue">b</span>) -> <span class="red">m</span> <span class="blue">b</span>
      <br>
      return :: <span class="blue">a</span> -> <span class="red">m</span> <span class="blue">a</span>
      <br>

    </div>
    <p>
      Similarly, comonads add structure to the input of the function.
      They tell us what's the <span class="red">context</span> and what's the <span class="blue">focus</span>.
      The focus can be thought of as the data being acted on, e.g. a boid.
      Whereas the context carries other resources that influence this action but are <em>not</em> influenced by it, e.g.
      the rest of the flock.
      Ultimately, the distinction will depend on the application as with monads.
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      f :: <span class="red">w</span> <span class="blue">a</span> -> b
    </div>
    <p>
      As you might expect, comonads must also satisfy analogous laws.

      In order to understand the dual notion of composition, we can think of a comonad as a container.
      Within this container, there are many objects of type <span class="blue">a</span> that have some relation to each
      other such as occupying neighbouring cells of a grid.
      One of the elements, or positions, is the current focus.
      However, we could focus on any of them, and they will all have a different view of
      their context, e.g. a different set of neighbours.

      Comonads must come equipped with a function for <em>extracting</em> the current focus while disregarding the
      context.
      And one for <em>extending</em> a context-aware operation on elements to the entire container.

    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      extend :: (<span class="red">w</span> <span class="blue">a</span> -> <span class="blue">b</span>) ->
      <span class="red">w</span> <span class="blue">a</span> -> <span class="red">w</span> <span class="blue">b</span>
      <br>
      extract :: <span class="red">w</span> <span class="blue">a</span> ->
      <span class="blue">a</span>
    </div>

    <p>
      Under this intuition, the laws roughly translate as:
    <ul>
      <li>Extracting the focus at every position in a container must equate to the original container</li>
      <li>Extending a context-aware operation to a container and then extracting the focus must be the same as applying
        the context-aware operation to the original container and its original focus.</li>
      <li>And finally, the composition of extended context-aware operations should associate. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>
      The Flock Comonad
    </h2>

    <p>
      Our three boid update functions have a natural focus and context: the current boid we're updating, and the rest of
      the flock.
      We can think of a flock is a <span class="red">container</span> full of
      <span class="blue">boids</span>.
      The position of each boid is its coordinate, in say 2-dimensional space.
      Interestingly though, as all space is relative, no boid is aware of its own location. Instead, boids are only
      aware of their position relative to one another. The context, therefore, contains vectors from the focus to the
      other
      boids. At the origin, i.e. the zero vector (0, 0), the boid in focus may be found.
    </p>

    <div class="code-line">
      <span class="purple">type</span> <span class="red">Flock</span> <span class="blue">a</span> = Map (Int, Int) <span
        class="blue">a</span>
    </div>

    <p>
      It's in the extension of context-aware operation the real magic happens.
      For simplicity, let's consider extending the identity function, this will replace each boid with its view of the
      flock.
      However, our boids are rather egotistic and see themselves as the centre of the flock.
      Their view will be inversely shifted by their own displacement vector, so they occupy the origin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Extending more intresting operations corresponds to applying a context-aware operation to each of the inner flocks
      of this visualisation.
    </p>

    <h2>Comonadic Boids</h2>

    <p>
      What is the payoff from all this book-keeping?
      We can now define the forces that act upon boids, in a natural manner - one boid at a time, without worrying about
      how this affects the flock overall.
      This separation of concerns highlights the fact that self-organisation is an emergent property.
      Consider the implementation of the cohesion force for example:
    </p>

    <div class="code-line">
      <span class="green">-- NOT: Flock Boid -> Flock Boid </span>
      <br>
      separate :: <span class="red">Flock</span> <span class="blue">Boid</span> -> <span class="blue">Boid</span>
      <br>
      separate flock =
      <br>
      &nbsp; <span class="purple">let</span> boid = extract flock
      <br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; centre = foldrWithKey (\v _ acc -> v + acc) 0 flock
      <br>
      &nbsp; &thinsp; <span class="purple">in</span> steerTo boid centre

    </div>

    <p>
      Even the type of this function hints that this is a force applied to boids rather than an arbitrary operation on
      flocks.
      Which could be anything from adding a hundred extra boids to eliminate those which are too far from the origin.
      In summary, the right representation of data should take into consideration the relevant operations and obscure dangerous ones.
      Catering to these can make code more lucid and consequently easier to maintain.

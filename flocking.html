      The ability of nature to organise itself is not just impressive but often beautiful too.
      When a group of starlings flock together, they create a mesmerising acrobatic performance.
      Apparently, we're not the only species that like to dance!

      It's not just biologists that find the sight fascinating.
      There is a whole field of computer science dedicated to abstracting and replicating these emergent behaviours,
      particularly in optimisation.
      If you can't beat 'em, join 'em!
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Boids</em> was one of the first algorithms designed to mimic flocking behaviour.
      Each boid is governed by three simple forces:
    <ul>
      <li>Separation: try not to crash</li>
      <li>Cohesion: follow the crowd</li>
      <li>Alignment: look where the crowd is looking</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      While these forces update individual boids, they are inherently dependent on the position of neighbouring boids,
      let's call it the <em>context</em>&#8230;
    </p>

    <h2>
      Context-aware Pogramming
    </h2>

    <p>
      While monads have been widely adopted in the functional programming community, their dual, <em>co</em>-monads,
      are sadly not so popular &#128542;
      I'm going to assume you've already come across the former as there are so many brilliant <a
        href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2016/11/21/monads-programmers-definition/">monad tutorials</a> that my
      introduction would just confuse the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefly though monads are just a convention for adding structure to the output of a function.
      This allows us to clearly differentiate between the <span class="highlight-blue">result</span> and its
      <span class="highlight-red">side-effects</span>:
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      f :: a -> <span class="highlight-red">m</span> <span class="highlight-blue">b</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      The side-effects must be composable, and there is a notion of having no side-effects, i.e. being <em>pure</em>:
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      join :: <span class="highlight-red">m</span> (<span class="highlight-red">m</span> <span
        class="highlight-blue">a</span>) -> <span class="highlight-red">m</span> <span class="highlight-blue">a</span>
      <br>
      return :: <span class="highlight-blue">a</span> -> <span class="highlight-red">m</span> <span
        class="highlight-blue">a</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      Similarly, comonads add structure to the input of the function; they tell us what's the <span
        class="highlight-red">context</span> and what's the <span class="highlight-blue">focus</span>.
      How do we decide which bit of information belongs where? Well, this is no different to deciding what counts as a
      <em>side</em>-effect; perhaps I meant to put that bug there!?&#8230; it depends on the application.
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      f :: <span class="highlight-red">w</span> <span class="highlight-blue">a</span> -> b
    </div>
    <p>
      The corresponding notion of being <em>pure</em> is when the function doesn't depend on it's context.
      The <em>extract</em> function does exactly that, just returning the focus:
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      extract :: <span class="highlight-red">w</span> <span class="highlight-blue">a</span> ->
      <span class="highlight-blue">a</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      To understand the analogous notion of composition, it is best to think of our comonad as some sort of container.
      Within this container there are lots of objects of type <span class="highlight-blue">a</span>, one of which is the
      current focus. However, we could focus on any of them, and they will all have a different view of their context.
      The <em>duplicate</em> function records this context from each possible perspective, creating a container of
      containers:
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      duplicate :: <span class="highlight-red">w</span> <span class="highlight-blue">a</span> ->
      <span class="highlight-red">w</span> (<span class="highlight-red">w</span> <span class="highlight-blue">a</span>)
    </div>

    <h2>
      The Flock Comonad
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our three boid update functions have a natural focus and context; the current boid we're updating and it's
      neighbours.
      In other words, the flock is a <span class="highlight-red">container</span> full of
      <span class="highlight-blue">boids</span> that is ripe for comonadification.
    </p>
    <div class="code-line">
      type Flock a = R2 -> Maybe a
    </div>
    <p>
      Concretely, a flock is represented by a partial function between positions and boids.
      The boid in focus will always be in position (0, 0).
      But it's in the duplicate function that the real magic happens:
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      As we just mentioned, each boid will have a different view of the flock, and the duplicate function encodes this
      view. In terms of linear algebra we can think of each boid being replaced by a copy of the flock except there has
      been a change of basis so that the focus, i.e. the zero point, is that boid.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can now compose and <em>extend</em> our boid update functions so that they apply to the entire flock in a
      particularly clean way.
      <div class="code-line">
        applyForce = extend cohesion . extend align . extend separation
      </div>

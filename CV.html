      <h2>Intensional Datatype Refinements &dash; POPL21</h2>
      <p>
        In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01452">this paper</a>, we present a higher-order program analysis that
        detects any pattern-matching errors.
        More importantly, however, unlike previous approaches, we tackle the issue of performance.
        By uncovering the right restrictions, we create a <em>compositional</em> analysis that is ultimately linear in the size of the program!
      </p>

      <p>
        Its performance is witnessed not just by a formal complexity guarantee but also an efficient implementation as a <a
          href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/intensional-datatys">GHC plugin</a>.

      <h2>BSc (Hons) Mathematics and Computer Science &dash; University of Bristol</h2>
      <p>
        It is hard to summarise any qualification that spans several years in a few paragraphs, but especially so when academic achievements are entwined with personal development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can, however, contrast the experience to some advice which I thankfully ignored: doing joint honours will make you a jack of all trades and a master of none.
        Quite the opposite, I have found that fluency in mathematical thinking has given me the analytical skills necessary to shed new light on the practical challenges faced in computer science.

      <h2>The Dynamics of Dialects</h2>
      <p>
        My undergraduate dissertation focused on a different type of language - natural languages.
        And in particular, the remarkable way in which huge populations have agreed upon coherent systems for communication.
        It received a first-class mark of 87&#37;.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/109/18/6819.full">model</a> of language acquisition to investigate how social <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">networks</a> influence the propagation of cultural symbols through a series of simulations.
        The most interesting result was that agents' propensity to distance themselves in response to a misunderstanding was a more a significant factor than the desire to connect with similar agents in the formation of homogenous communities.
        In the conclusion, I discussed the possible light this sheds on echo chambers.

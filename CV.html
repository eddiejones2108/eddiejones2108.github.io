      <h2>Intensional Datatype Refinements &dash; POPL21</h2>
      <p>
        In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01452">this paper</a>, we present a higher-order program analysis that
        detects any pattern-matching errors.
        More importantly, however, unlike previous approaches, we tackle the issue of performance.
        By uncovering the right restrictions, we create a <em>compositional</em> analysis that is ultimately linear in
        the size of the program!
      </p>

      <p>
        Its performance is witnessed not just by a formal complexity guarantee but also an efficient implementation as a
        <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/intensional-datatys">GHC plugin</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        My presentation on the paper is available <a
          href="https://app.clowdr.org/conference/popl2021/item/266b4009-5447-4082-b6aa-844001f7ccf6">here</a>.

      <h2>Programme-level Teaching Assistant</h2>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most rewarding teaching experience I have had to date is as a programme-level teaching assistant.
        This new unit is intended to cross module boundaries and encourage the students to think outside the box.
        It has also been enjoyable to lead more flexible tutorial-like sessions where it is possible to build a rapport with the students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again this year saw an increase in responsibility &mdash; I become lead teaching assistant for the Types &amp; &lambda;-Calculus unit as well as producing problem sheets for programme-level tutorial sessions (on bisimulation and <a href = "http://math.andrej.com/2007/09/28/seemingly-impossible-functional-programs/">seemingly impossible functional programs</a>).

      <h2>Teaching Assistant </h2>
      <p>
        This year I took on a more senior role as lead teaching assistant for the Functional Programming unit in addition to assistanting with:

        <li> Types &amp; &lambda;-Calculus </li>
        <li> Theory of Computation </li>

        It is hard to summarise any qualification that spans several years in a few paragraphs, but especially so when
        academic achievements are entwined with personal development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can, however, contrast the experience to some advice which I thankfully ignored: doing joint honours will make
        you a jack of all trades and a master of none.
        Quite the opposite, I have found that fluency in mathematical thinking has given me the analytical skills
        necessary to shed new light on the practical challenges faced in computer science.

      <h2>The Dynamics of Dialects</h2>
      <p>
        My undergraduate dissertation focused on a different type of language - natural languages.
        And in particular, the remarkable way in which huge populations have agreed upon coherent systems for
        communication.
        It received a first-class mark of 87&#37;.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/109/18/6819.full">model</a> of language acquisition to
        investigate how social <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">networks</a> influence the
        propagation of cultural symbols through a series of simulations.
        The most interesting result was that agents' propensity to distance themselves in response to a misunderstanding
        was a more a significant factor than the desire to connect with similar agents in the formation of homogenous
        communities.
        In the conclusion, I discussed the possible light this sheds on echo chambers.

      <p>
        I have always enjoyed conveying my passions for subjects, and so I was delighted to get some experience as a
        teaching assistant.
        Across the following units, I lead problem classes and helped the students in labs.

      <ul>
        <li> Functional Programming</li>
        <li>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms</li>

        This project considered the problem of designing a car park layout for a given space that maximised the number
        of cars.
        It involved a satisfying mix of calculus, geometry, and simulation (mostly in MATLAB).
